# Exercise_05

## abstract
Use the Euler method to calculate the trajectory of cannon shell.

## Background

## problem
* problem 2.6<br>
Use the Euler method to calculate cannon shell trajectories ignoring both air drag angd the effect of air density (actually, ignoring the former automatically rules out the latter). Compare your results with those in Figure 2.4, and with the exact solution.
* problem 2.8<br>
In our model of the cannon shell trajectory we have assumed that the acceleration due to gravity, g, is a constant. It will, of course, depend on altitude. Add this to the model and calculate how much it affects the range.
* problem 2.9<br>
Calculate the trajectory of our cannon shell including both air drag and the reduced air density at high altitudes so that you can reproduce the result in Figure 2.5. Perform your calculation for different firing angles and determine the value of the angle that give the maximum range.
