Calculate Poincar√© section for the pendulum as it undergoes the period-doubling route to chaos. Plot ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Comega) versus ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctheta), with one point plotted for each drive cycle, as in Figure 3.9. Do this for ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F_D) = 1.4, 1.44, 1.465, using the other parameters as given in connection with Figure 3.10. You should find that after removing the points corresponding to the initial transient the attractor in the period-1 regime will contain only a single point. Likewise, if the behavior is period n, the attractor will contain n discrete points.


Calculate the bifurcation diagrams for the pendulum in the vicinity of ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F_D) = 1.35 to 1.5. Make a magnified plot of the diagram (as compared to Figure 3.11) and obtain an estimate of the Feigenbaum ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdelta) parameter.
