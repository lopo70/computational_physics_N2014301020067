## Background
* Wave

In physics, a wave is an oscillation accompanied by a transfer of energy that travels through a medium (space or mass). Frequency refers to the addition of time. Wave motion transfers energy from one point to another, which displace particles of the transmission mediumâ€“that is, with little or no associated mass transport. Waves consist, instead, of oscillations or vibrations (of a physical quantity), around almost fixed locations.

There are two main types of waves. Mechanical waves propagate through a medium, and the substance of this medium is deformed. Restoring forces then reverse the deformation. For example, sound waves propagate via air molecules colliding with their neighbors. When the molecules collide, they also bounce away from each other (a restoring force). This keeps the molecules from continuing to travel in the direction of the wave.

The second main type, electromagnetic waves, do not require a medium. Instead, they consist of periodic oscillations of electrical and magnetic fields originally generated by charged particles, and can therefore travel through a vacuum. These types vary in wavelength, and include radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and gamma rays.

* Wave equation

The wave equation is a hyperbolic partial differential equation. It typically concerns a time variable t, one or more spatial variables ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_1%2Cx_2%2C%5Ccdot%20%5Ccdot%20%5Ccdot%20%2Cx_n), and a scalar function ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?u%20%3D%20u%20%28x_1%2Cx_2%2C%5Ccdot%20%5Ccdot%20%5Ccdot%20%2Cx_n%3Bt%29), whose values could model, for example, the mechanical displacement of a wave. The wave equation for u is

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%5E2%20u%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20t%5E2%7D%3Dc%5E2%5Ctriangledown%20%5E2u)

where ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctriangledown%20%5E2) is the (spatial) Laplacian and c is a fixed constant.

Solutions of this equation describe propagation of disturbances out from the region at a fixed speed in one or in all spatial directions, as do physical waves from plane or localized sources; the constant c is identified with the propagation speed of the wave. This equation is linear. Therefore, the sum of any two solutions is again a solution: in physics this property is called the superposition principle.

The wave equation alone does not specify a physical solution; a unique solution is usually obtained by setting a problem with further conditions, such as initial conditions, which prescribe the amplitude and phase of the wave. Another important class of problems occurs in enclosed spaces specified by boundary conditions, for which the solutions represent standing waves, or harmonics, analogous to the harmonics of musical instruments.

The wave equation, and modifications of it, are also found in elasticity, quantum mechanics, plasma physics and general relativity.

The wave equation in one space dimension can be written as follows:

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%5E2%20u%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20t%5E2%7D%20%3D%20c%5E2%5C%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%5E2%20u%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20x%5E2%7D).

This equation is typically described as having only one space dimension "x", because the only other independent variable is the time "t". Nevertheless, the dependent variable "u" may represent a second space dimension, if, for example, the displacement "u" takes place in y-direction, as in the case of a string that is located in the x-y plane.

In this section, the equation can be simulated as follows:

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y%28i%2Cn&plus;1%29%3D2%5B1-r%5E2%5Dy%28i%2Cn%29-y%28i%2Cn-1%29&plus;r%5E2%5By%28i&plus;1%2Cn%29&plus;y%28i-1%2Cn%29%5D)

* Piano

![](http://abc.2008php.com/2015_Website_appreciate/2015-03-19/20150319220649.jpg)

The piano is an acoustic, stringed musical instrument, in which the strings are struck by hammers. It is played using a keyboard, which is a row of keys (small levers) that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands to cause the hammers to strike the strings. Invented in about 1700 (the exact year is uncertain), the piano is widely employed in classical, jazz, traditional and popular music for solo and ensemble performances, accompaniment, and for composing, songwriting and rehearsals. Although the piano is very heavy and thus not portable and is expensive (in comparison with other widely used accompaniment instruments, such as the acoustic guitar), its musical versatility (i.e., its wide pitch range, ability to play chords with up to 10 notes, louder or softer notes and two or more independent musical lines at the same time), the large number of musicians and amateurs trained in playing it, and its wide availability in performance venues, schools and rehearsal spaces have made it one of the Western world's most familiar musical instruments.

We can see that the speeds of convergence of Jacobi method and Gauss-Seidel method are almost same while the SOR method has a faster speed of convergence. What's more, for Jacobi method and Gauss-Seidel method, ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?N_%7Biter%7D%5Cpropto%20L%5E2), while for SOR method, ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?N_%7Biter%7D%5Cpropto%20L).

## Conclusion

Use relaxation method can solve Laplace's equation.
